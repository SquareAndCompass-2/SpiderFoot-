ادات جلب معلوماتUSES SpiderFoot can be used offensively (e.g. in a red team exercise or penetration test) for reconnaissance of your target or defensively to gather information about what you or your organisation might have exposed over the Internet.  You can target the following entities in a SpiderFoot scan:  IP address Domain/sub-domain name Hostname Network subnet (CIDR) ASN E-mail address Phone number Username Person's name Bitcoin address SpiderFoot's 200+ modules feed each other in a publisher/subscriber model to ensure maximum data extraction to do things like:  Host/sub-domain/TLD enumeration/extraction Email address, phone number and human name extraction Bitcoin and Ethereum address extraction Check for susceptibility to sub-domain hijacking DNS zone transfers Threat intelligence and Blacklist queries API integration with SHODAN, HaveIBeenPwned, GreyNoise, AlienVault, SecurityTrails, etc. Social media account enumeration S3/Azure/Digitalocean bucket enumeration/scraping IP geo-location Web scraping, web content analysis Image, document and binary file meta data analysis Dark web searches Port scanning and banner grabbing Data breach searches So much more... INSTALLING &amp; RUNNING To install and run SpiderFoot, you need at least Python 3.6 and a number of Python libraries which you can install with pip.
